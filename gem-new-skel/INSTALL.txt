== What is a Trust Policy? What is High Security?

A Trust Policy with High Security is how you can guarantee 
that a gem is tamper-proof and comes from the real developers.

Our developers use a digital signature to sign all our gems,
and the gem command uses a digital certificate to verify us.

To see your gem certificate list:

  sudo gem cert --list

Our cert looks like this:

  /C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=SixArm/CN=sixarm.com

To learn more about the gem trust policy and high security,
