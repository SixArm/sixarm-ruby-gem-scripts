These are Ruby gem scripts for simple gem management, inspection, etc.

There are three kinds of tools here:

  - The "gemspec" scripts that are generally useful for
    extracting simple information from a gemspec stream.

  - Various misc scripts, such as a ruby script that can
    convert a file's first Ruby comment to a README.rdoc file.

  - A list of the gems we typically use

You can customize these however you like for your own systems.
