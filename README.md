## Introduction

There are three kinds of tools here:

  * The "gemspec" scripts that are generally useful for
    extracting simple information from a gemspec stream.

  * Various misc scripts, such as a ruby script that can
    convert a file's first Ruby comment to a README.rdoc file.

  * A list of the gems we typically use

You can customize these however you like for your own systems.
